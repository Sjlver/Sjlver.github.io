{: #mugshot}

I am Jonas Wagner, a computer science researcher, traveller, avid book reader,
guitar player, boyscout...

In my [research](/research/), I build tools that help developers create better
software. I'm researching an exciting new technique that we call *elastic
instrumentation*. It allows developers to strengthen their programs using
instrumentation while keeping control over the runtime overhead. Previously, I
have worked on symbolic execution, a technique that analyzes programs on
multiple execution paths and automatically finds bugs.

It's important to me that research has a strong connection to the real world.
This is why I published [the ASAP technique][asap] as open-source code. For more
information about tools, publications, and internships, please consult [my
CV][cv].

While traveling, I enjoy hiking and marveling at all the beauty in nature, the
night sky, the mountains... It was [a trip to the Rocky
Mountains][a_travelers_diary] which caused me to start this blog back in 2014.
