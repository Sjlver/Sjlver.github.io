I am Jonas Wagner, a software engineer, traveler, computer science researcher,
avid book reader, guitar player, boyscout...

In my work, I write code to track mosquito nets for the [Against Malaria
Foundation][amf]. My goal is to prove to our donors and myself that the mosquito
nets arrive where they should, are being put to use, and effectively protect
people from malaria.

In my [research](/research/), I built tools that help developers create better
software. I researched a technique named *elastic instrumentation*. It allows
developers to strengthen their programs using instrumentation while keeping
control over the runtime overhead. It's important to me that research has a
strong connection to the real world. This is why I published [the ASAP
technique][asap] as open-source code. For more information about tools,
publications, and internships, please consult [my CV][cv].

While traveling, I enjoy hiking and marveling at all the beauty in nature, the
night sky, the mountains... It was [a trip to the Rocky
Mountains][a_travelers_diary] which caused me to start this blog back in 2014.
