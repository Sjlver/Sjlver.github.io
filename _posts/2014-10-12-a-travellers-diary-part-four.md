It's a bright, worry-free Friday morning after a dark night. Getting in my
frozen hiking trousers and cold wet shoes needs some overcoming, but
turns out to be less uncomfortable than expected. I collect my Bearvault from
where it landed, and look for a nice breakfast place.

A few meters up the stream is a large opening with a weather station. I will
never forget the breakfast I had there, in the cold, under a clear sky and
towering mountain cliff, beneath the setting moon. My breakfast consists of
bread with peanut butter (*no refrigeration needed,* says the label on the jar),
carrots and dried fruit. There is also some milk left, except that the
tetrapack hasn't survived the not-quite-seventy-steps-throw so well. Never
mind...

Around eight o'clock, my bag is packed and I'm on my way again. Coming down to
*Icy Creek*, I see two fresh footprints on the way to *Sky Pond*. Some people
must have been up really early. This is the first sign of other people I've seen
for 16 hours, and it will take two more hours until I meet the first humans.

*The Loch* lies motionless, its far end fading away in the clouds. A thin ice
crust covers the parts near the shore. As I continue walking, I realize that my
feet aren't cold anymore. At nine, I take off my jacket. A song comes to my
mind; we have sung it at a wedding this summer. I sing it as I continue, and it
feels as if life couldn't get any better at this moment.

> Que la grâce et la paix du Seigneur  
> Soient déposées sur vous, sur vos cœurs  
> Et que sa lumière vienne éclairer vos vies  
> Par le nom de Jésus Christ.

As I overlook the valley, with snow-laden trees spreading away towards the
cloudy horizon, I can feel some of the spirit that early pioneers must have
felt, when they came here in search for gold, a better life, or just for a vague
idea of *freedom.*

Soon, I arrive at *Bear Lake*. I leave my backpack in the forest, and walk
around the perimeter of the lake. Rarely have I seen such beautiful reflections.
The clouds have cleared away, and I see the mountains clearly, together with
their perfect copies in the lake. It's funny though, that one sees the
reflection from a slightly different angle. Clouds for example are not in the
same place.

Now I have definitely entered civilization again. One sign of this is the
initials that people have carved into the otherwise-so-beautiful, bright stems
of the Aspen trees. Here I feel the need for a digression: carving one's
initials in a tree is one of the *stupidest* things in the world. I guess people
do it out of ignorance about how trees live, so let me take a paragraph to
explain.

There are two systems of flows inside a tree. The core of the tree, despite
being solid wood, contains microscopic channels where water moves upwards from
the roots thanks to capillary action. Conversely, sugar is being produced in
the leaves and flows downwards just underneath the bark, where it is used to
grow the tree and its roots. Carving something in the bark effectively cuts off
this flow of nutrients, preventing the tree from growing. Besides, the wound
hardly heals, and becomes an attack vector for bacteria, fungi, and illnesses.

From *Bear Lake*, there is a free shuttle to the discovery center. Barry has
assured me that there is a path from there to the visitor center, through the
forest. This is the path I am searching, because I want to give back the
Bearvault.

Sure enough, a narrow track starts at the visitor center, leading approximately
in the right direction. From time to time, I see small round animal excrements
on the way. I would soon find out which animals produced them. In fact, these
last two miles of my Rocky Mountains Park trip would turn out to be most
memorable.

I have not walked long when I hear the bird again:

I have heard it several times during the trip, and wondered what kind of bird
it was. This time, I stop and see it -- except it isn't a bird. The sound is
produced by a squirrel! I see the small thing as it races down a tree, and
chases a competitor off another. The two of them disappear in the grass.

A few hundred steps later, I suddenly stop moving. Before me, across the
trail, not even hundred meters away, stands a group of elk. It must be the herd
that I saw yesterday from the car: 19 females, and a bit uphill, the bull.

Unmoving, we watch each other for a few minutes. After a while, the animals
start trotting uphill, and I cautiously continue along the trail. As I am past
the herd, I hear it for the first time: the cry of an elk bull. It's a
high-pitched sound, hard to describe... maybe a bit like an ungreased door being
closed?

The trail continues through meadows strewn with rocks and pine trees. The
climate is warmer here than up in the mountains, and by now the sun is shining
strongly. Around noon, I decide to pause and have lunch.

While I am sitting within a group of pines, chewing my bread with *Wisconsin
Apple-smoked Gruyere Cheese*, two young elk bulls come out of the trees, about
150 meters away. They look at me, then lie down. The bulls start chewing
their cud looking at me, and I chew my food staring back. This way, we stay
until I've finished my meal and continue along the trail.

I pass one more herd of elk before I abruptly see a camping lot before me.
Nature and civilization are close together indeed in this park. I feel like
leaving a fantasy tale, and go looking for the street to the visitor center.

Once there, I return the Bearvault and tell my story to Barry. Then, it's time
to definitely re-enter civilization: have a shave in the visitor center
restroom, and use their free wifi to my heart's content to find out what has
happened in Switzerland during my time in the wild.

The lady ranger at the visitor center kindly hands me an old cardboard box. I
make a sign out of it:

> Want to take me to BOULDER or DENVER?  
> By the way, I tell great stories :)

It turns out that this works fairly well. Soon, I'm in Mike's car (Mike is also
an ex-hitchhiker) and driving towards Estes Park. He drops me just outside the
town, at the highway to Boulder. Only about thirty passing cars later (on a
well-frequented road) I meet Nick. He's a professional hockey player and
fisherman with a degree in economics. Living in Denver, he takes me all the way
to Broadway in Downtown Denver. From there, it's a short walk until I put down
my backpack where it all started, at the Melbourne Hostel.
