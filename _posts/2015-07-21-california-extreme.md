*California Extreme* sounds like a fitting title for my internship, doesn't it?
Instead, it is the name of an arcade and pinball show. What's that, you
ask? Watch the video!

I felt like a total geek for a day, and so did the thousands of people around
me. Everybody was trying old and new games. Experts were around to teach how
something works. This includes two pinball world champions, who took their time
to explain what a live catch is and how to do a slap save. I totally enjoyed the
time.

Video credits: Among the stars are Scott and Alex (two fellow Google interns
seen playing Panik Park), the energy thieves (we won!), Raymond Davidson, and
two other pinball world champions. The music is the Cucco Medley, played by
Kirby's Dream Band.
