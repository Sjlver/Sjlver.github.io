I have made a decision. It is interesting, not only because of the result, but
also because it took six years. Why did it take me that long? Does this teach me
something to making better, higher-quality decisions?

The decision that I've made is to *live a vegan life henceforth.* Or maybe I
should call it an AVAP life (as vegan as possible) since I don't want to make a
big fuss or lose friends about dietary choices. In this post, I'll explain (1)
how this decision came to be, (2) what I have learned for future decisions, and
(3) what the implications are for my life to come.

you're not interested in my personal journey :)

## My journey to a vegan lifestyle

Back in 2015, I wrote the [story of Blackie](/travel/2015/07/24/blackie.html) on
the day when I became a vegetarian. At the end of that post, I wrote:

Becoming vegetarian had felt *good* because it had indeed ended one of my
cognitive dissonances; a nagging feeling in my consciousness that maybe eating
an animal wasn't right. Interestingly, becoming vegan has felt much the same.
Behind that first step toward a more ethical life has awaited a next step. And
I am now convinced that I am still far from being a virtuous person. There will
forever be aspects of my character that I must improve. My decision to be vegan
feels like a step in the right direction... but I realize now that it is a small
step in a lifelong journey.

The journey is, most of all, a journey shaped by people around me. It began in
2014 when a friend invited me to a hackathon. We built the first version of a
web app that would become [Veganaut](https://veganaut.net/), a community-driven
guide for vegan restaurants and shops. During the days of the hackathon, my
friends would cook for the group -- it was delicious (except maybe the Pizza
without cheese :-P). I learned a lot during that hackathon, from setting up
MongoDB over tasting nutritional yeast all the way to discussing the ethics of
cow milk production. I'm very thankful for the friends who invited me, and hope
that they will some day find out about the impact that they had.

I remember thinking back then that veganism was too extreme. I felt that
veganism excludes too many things that I like. Cheese for example, but also the
picturesque presence of cows on the Swiss hills around me, filling the air with
the sound of their bells. Even today, I believe that some human-animal
relationships are truly symbiotic and should be encouraged.

In the years that followed, I've been in touch with many vegan people: I
remember my guitar teacher. He always brought some fruit with him. And he told
me with sadness that he compromised on lute frets, because there was no better
material than sheep gut for making these. I also remember a friend who wrote a
list of all food they threw away, publicly visible on their fridge, in order to
combat food waste. I remember other friends who impressed me because they lived
vegan for 40 days before Easter and Christmas, as is the tradition in the
Romanian Orthodox Church to which they belong.

When I joined Google as a software engineer, I entered a vegan land of plenty.
The company made it super easy to *try out* a vegan life rather than just
observing it. Which other company would stock their fridges with five different
types of milk? I have the privilege to work with some of the smartest people
I've ever met. A surprisingly high number of them are vegan. One of my
colleagues invited me to the Christmas dinner pictured on the right -- it was
one of the best dinners I'd had in months.

The last step in my learning process was [Veganuary](https://veganuary.org).
Veganuary is a non-profit organization as well as a challenge to live a
plant-based life during January. Another colleague from work talked me into it.
During January, she went above and beyond, organizing movie screenings and
sending out restaurant recommendations... During this month, I tried more
different foods and cooked more varied meals than ever before. And when the end
of the month came, my wife and I decided to continue.

## What have I learned about decisions?

Looking back at my decision to become vegan, I was puzzled: *why did this
decision take so long to make?* Here's one way to think about this:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/pictures/thingking_fast_and_slow/decision-impact-vs-time.png"
       style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="Decisions, shown as bubble chart of impact vs decision time">
</p>

The graph shows various decisions, each as a bubble. Bubbles on the left are
decisions that I took quickly, and bubbles on the right are decisions about
which I thought for a long time.

The y axis represents the decisions' impact: decisions near the top of the graph
are important and affect me every day. Decisions at the bottom are no big deal.

I conclude that my best decisions are those where the *decision time* roughly
corresponds to the decision's *impact*. In other words, it has probably been OK
to think long and carefully about what I eat, since that decision changes my
life every single day. On the other hand, I guess I shouldn't fret half as much
as I have over buying an e-book reader.

Drawing this chart also made me realize that I should think more deliberately
about my work. I'm very happy in my current job... but joining Google had been a
decision made quickly, without evaluating too many alternatives. Have I been too
eager to join the tech giant?

## Where to go now

Looking forward... I will eat differently. But more importantly, I want to think
more actively about ethics and my choices. In the past, I did not always believe
that I really, truly, had choices. I did not always have the self-confidence to
make my own decisions. I would worry a lot about what my family, my friends, and
my role models said. Taking the step to a vegan life has, in fact, boosted my
self-confidence ;-)

I want to thank all the friends and people whom I've mentioned in this blog
post. And I'd like to thank my wife, who made this step together with me, and
without whom I could not have done it (so much for self-confidence :-P). And
thanks to my family, who accepted the news with kindness and grace.
