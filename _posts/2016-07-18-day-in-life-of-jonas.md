Many people asked me what I'm doing in Berkeley. This post gives a few
impressions of my life and work here. With six pictures and an explanation of
the Cyber Grand Challenge.

**5:58:** I'm leaving home early because I want to go to a morning bible study.
The picture below shows my home and Totoro, my trusty bike. I call it
[Totoro][totoro] because it had to wait for me in the rain a couple times, back
in March when Berkeley had rain :)

Bible study is a nice way to start the day, and has become an important part of
my routine. The organizer is a theology student from China. He is an insightful
person with a great heart. Usually, we're half a dozen participants from all
over the world.

After bible study, I stop at the "Cybercafe" for a breakfast of oatmeal and
coffee, and for a bit of reading.

**8:25:** Next stop: office. I work on the 7th floor of Soda Hall, UC Berkeley's
computer science building. A framed message welcomes visitors: *Welcome to the
7th floor, home of top-shelf computer scientists.* Boastful maybe, but there are
indeed lots of really smart people here.

In the last four months, I've worked on a system to protect computer programs.
We named it *BinKungfu* because it analyzes and modifies computer binaries, to
protect them from vulnerabilities. It does binary self-defense against hackers
:)

*BinKungfu* is part of an even bigger system that can protect and attack
computer programs, completely automatically. On August 4, it will battle against
six other systems, in a competition called *Cyber Grand Challenge*. If it finds
the most bugs and protect the most programs, we might become famous in the
hacker community :) In any case, I look forward to travel to Las Vegas and watch
the competition. Here's a preview video that explains what it's about:

Working with the BinKungfu team is an interesting experience. We are five people
in a shared office, and collaborate very closely. The picture below shows me
doing a code review of our *cyber reasoning system.*

**21:37:** And so the day goes by, with code reviews, discussions, programming,
and Skype calls. It's late evening when the last
[LGTM][lgtm] is submitted and I head home. On my way home, there are several
places selling [boba tea][boba] (Californians love it). I stop, get a green milk
tea with pearls, and walk home happily.
