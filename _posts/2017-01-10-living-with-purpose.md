Resolved, after seeing *Rogue One*, to live more intentionally. To devote
more attention to the purpose of what I'm doing. To do more of the things I
like.

On my bike, riding home from the cinema, I enjoyed the fresh air and the snow and
the moon shining through the clouds. I felt alive. I was moving, breathing,
experiencing the beauty of the world around me. One with the force, if you will.

In that moment, I felt some pity for the characters in Rogue One. People caught
up in their wars, fighting for so many things that don't matter, losing their
lives for a rebellion, finding family only to watch them die. In this war movie,
peace is a short moment on the beach before an explosion rips you apart.

And what about me? I resolve to spend my time more purposefully. To take my
guitar to the lakeside from time to time. To sing and pray more. To go running.
To think about the usefulness of my research, and to work on it with all my
heart. To love the people around me and show that love to them while they're
alive. To love God with heart, soul, mind, strength.
