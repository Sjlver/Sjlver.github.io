Do you remember the Windfish Tune? This post is for people who do. If you don't
know the tune... [it's nothing special][tune]. The tune gets its worth from the
memories that we attach to it. The movie [Ready Player One][movie] is about such
memories.

As I write this, I'm flying high above the Atlantic Ocean and I've just watched
the movie. It has truly moved me. *Ready Player One* is great; go watch it. I
will tell you a bit about why I think the movie is great, and a bit about its
themes. I decided to do so in two versions. The first is a version for people
who might have heard the Windfish tune. The second version comes with
explanations of all the slang and hidden understandings, so that if you're not
into gaming you might still enjoy reading it. Here we go:

![Parzival with VR gear](/assets/pictures/ready_player_one/parzival_with_vr_gear.jpg)

### Well Played, Parzival

*Ready Player One* tells the story of a James Halliday, a man who designed
games. Not only designed games, actually. Halliday *loved* computer games. They
were his life. IRL, the man dies and before he dies, he places into his game an
epic treasure hunt: three keys for players to find to open the way to an easter
egg that will grant root privileges.

*Ready Player One* also tells the story of Parzival, Aech, Art3mis, Sho, and
Daito. They are players in OASIS, *the* game. Think epic open-world VR
Action-RPG, where you can take your char from Azeroth to EVE and back to the
Old Republic, while trying out some 80's arcade machines on the way. Everyone is
playing it. Most people are casual players, but the committed, the Easter Egg
hunters, the *Gunters...* they put all their might into winning the race to the
three keys. And then there's Innovative Online Industries (IOI), the corp that
represents the commercial side of the game. They're in the race too, cause being
root means you get to control the ads. Fortunately they're quite bad at both the
game and Adtech.[^1]

The race unfolds with beautiful visuals, smart pop-culture references, and IMO
witty philosophical bits about the value of the real world. Granted, the story
is not too surprising and the bad guys are clearly labeled. The heroes are
good-looking and not painted very deeply... but for me this was not what
mattered in the movie. Instead...

At the core of *Ready Player One* is the mission of fighting for what you love.
The vision that playing is about joy and memories and not about commercial
success. I feel that, in a world where art consists mostly of sequels,[^2] both
this movie and its message are refreshing. Goethe once wrote, "du bist am Ende,
was du bist", meaning that what counts in the end is the memories we make and
the character we develop while we spend our lives. Personally, I would not want
to miss the memories of discovering all Wario's castles, sitting on the beach
with Malon, ceremonially burying my WoW character before the start of
university, seeing the princess' rescue in reverse time and in a different
light, receiving the farewell-Ocarina from Saria, scoring my first airhit goal,
or passing *I can walk on water* at 85% speed. I have yet to get to 100% speed,
and after watching this movie I'm motivated to try.

### The Non-Player's Guide to *Ready Player One*

If you're not a gamer, should you watch this movie? Maybe. If you liked *Avatar*
or *Matrix* or *Inception* or *the Truman Show* I'm quite sure you would like
*Ready Player One*. The movie combines aspects of all of four: an exploration of
virtual reality; bombastic battles; hunts that take place in both the real and
fictional worlds, simultaneously; and finally the decision to choose the real
life in the face of a god-like power offering all the virtual wealth of the
world.

Childhood memories are another theme of the movie. Is there something that you
loved as a child and have given up since? For me, computer games fall into that
category. To be honest, I have not given them up 100%... and when I became
a computer scientist, I made a remake of [Pukul Lalat, the classic game of my
childhood][pukullalat]. For me, *Ready Player One* brought back a lot of joyful
memories from the past, and I think you might get this feeling from the movie
even if your source of joyful memories is board games or a boyscout treasure
hunt or music or dancing or sports or something completely different. 

Finally, as promised, some explanations that might help you understand the first
part of the article, if you so desire. Otherwise, you might want to just go
watch the movie instead ;-)

OASIS, the game in the movie, is a big virtual world where people appear as
avatars, taking the shape, form, race or sex that they desire. In real life
(IRL) each avatar corresponds to a person in 2045's earth, wearing a full-body
virtual reality suit and a headset that simulates the audio, video and tactile
signals from the game. However, many people do no longer spend a lot of time in
real life, instead preferring the sensations and freedom of OASIS.

The conflict in the movie is a fight between gamers who love OASIS for the
experiences they can get there and the friendships that they make, and a
corporation called IOI who wants to take control of the game for profit. In the
game, both parties are bound by the rules of the virtual world, and all try to
win the three keys, special items that would grant their owners unlimited
virtual power.

![Parzival gets first to the key](/assets/pictures/ready_player_one/first_to_the_key.jpg)

A large number of classic games references appear throughout the movie. There
are current blockbusters like EVE online (a spaceship battle game taking place
in a complex virtual world), Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (a
role-playing game (RPG) where players are in the shoes of a Jedi knight) or
World of Warcraft (WoW, probably the world's most popular massively multiplayer
online role playing game).[^3] Classic games also appear, for example when a
virtual fistfight turns into a game of Street Fighter, complete with combos and
special effects from the original game. And then there are prominent appearances
of *Space Invaders* and *Adventure*, some of the first ever computer games.
Succeeding in OASIS means finding a so-called *Easter Egg* in Adventure: a
hidden feature where the game developer placed his signature in the game because
he was particularly fond of it.

If you are not into computer games, then this movie can show you that they were
not always big commercial projects. There are brilliant games out there that
create wonderful worlds and tell captivating stories. If you want to experience
some of my favorite memories, here are the links that correspond to the memories
I've mentioned above. Many of these games that used to run on consoles can
nowadays be played on a smartphone or laptop, because of how much faster
computers have become in the meantime. And if you get stuck, don't hesitate to
ask me. Have a lot of fun, and make good memories :)

- Discovering all Wario's castles: You get a different one depending on how many
  bags of money you have at the end of [Warioland].
- Sitting on the beach with Malon: A cutscene in [the Legend of Zelda: Link's
  Awakening]. This is also where you'll hear the Windfish's tune at the end.
- Ceremonially burying my [WoW] character: I did this before I started studying
  for my bachelor at EPFL, out of fear that gaming would make me a bad student.
- Seeing the princess' rescue in reverse time: This is the brilliant (really,
  brilliant) end of [Braid]. If you try out just one of the games in this list,
  go for Braid. It will change the way you think about computer games and will
  make you understand Zeneki's Cube in *Ready Player One* :)
- Receiving the farewell-Ocarina from Saria: this is a scene from [the Legend
  of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]. Voted [best videogame ever][zelda-best] by many.
- Scoring my first airhit goal was elating. You need to play [Rocket League] to
  get that feeling.
- Passing *I can walk on water* at 85% speed: Come visit me IRL and I'll
  introduce you to [Dance Dance Revolution].

Oh... and one last thing: Don't be the [colossal douchebag][douchebag] named
Nolan Sorrento. [Enable two-factor authentication][2fa] :)

[^1]: Placing ads on 80% of the field of view is not smart; Adtech is more
    subtle: Companies like Google or Facebook determine purchase intents, design
    amazing landing pages, manage people's attention carefully, target ads
    precisely. Ads in the real world might be less intrusive than what is
    portrayed in the movie, but not less effective or dystopian..
